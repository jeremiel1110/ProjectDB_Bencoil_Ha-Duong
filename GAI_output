## Data business rules (spoken like a climbing-gym product owner)

* A **gym** can contain several **walls** (bouldering area, lead wall, training board area), and each wall belongs to **one** gym.
* A **wall** is identified inside a gym (name/zone) and has a **type** (boulder / lead / auto-belay / training board).
* A **route** (or boulder problem) is **set on one wall** and is defined by setters, style and grade; it can be changed over time (re-set).
* Each **route** has a **creation date** (when it is opened to climbers) and a **removal date** (when it is taken down); a route may still be active (no removal date yet).
* A route can have a **color** (holds/tape) and a **tag/label** used by the gym (e.g., “Comp style”, “Slab”, “Kids”).
* A route can be marked **available / unavailable** (e.g., maintenance, holds missing, wall closed), independently from removal.
* A **climber** creates an account with personal contact info and chooses privacy options for their activity.
* A climber can be a member of **zero or more groups** (friends team, club, university group).
* A **group** has one **owner/manager** (a climber) who can invite or remove members.
* A **subscription** links a climber to a gym (or chain) and defines the access level and validity period.
* A climber can have **at most one active subscription at a time** for a given gym.
* A **session** is created by one climber and represents a visit/training period, with a start date/time and (optionally) an end time.
* A session can be associated to **one gym** (where the climber climbed) and optionally a specific wall area.
* During a session, a climber records **attempts** on routes (tries), and can mark a route as **topped** (sent) within that session.
* For a given route in a session, the climber can record **multiple attempts** and keep only one final outcome (topped or not topped).
* The system keeps the **attempt count** and/or detailed attempt info (e.g., flash, number of tries), depending on how the climber logs it.
* A climber may record an attempt even if the route was later removed; the historical record remains.
* A climber can add **notes** about a route attempt (beta, conditions, injury note).
* A session can include general metrics (perceived effort, duration) and optional training notes.
* Grades can be stored as the gym’s grading system (Font/V-scale/YDS) and may vary by gym preferences.
* Routes may have optional **setter names** and an internal route reference used by staff.
* Groups can organize sessions as “group sessions” (optional) to compare results among members.
* The system must prevent recording a session without a climber, and prevent recording a route without a wall and a gym.
* Only the climber (and possibly group managers if the climber agrees) can edit or delete their session logs.

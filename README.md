# ClimbDB

## Overview

ClimbDB is a database design project that models the ecosystem of indoor climbing gyms.

The goal of this database is to represent how climbers interact with climbing gyms and routes over time. The system is designed to store structured information about:

* Climbers and their profiles
* Climbing sessions
* Routes (with creation and removal dates)
* Walls inside gyms
* Gym locations
* Group memberships
* Subscriptions

The database allows us to model real-world climbing activity in a structured and consistent way. It ensures that performance tracking, route lifecycle management, and membership systems can be represented clearly and without redundancy.

## Project Structure (Part 1)

Part 1 includes:

* The prompt used to gather requirements
* The output generated by the AI and our modifications of it
* Looping file for the MCD representation of the database

## Prompt Used

### Explanation of the Prompt

The prompt was designed using a structured framework to simulate communication with a company in the climbing industry.

It specifies:

* The role of the AI (acting as a climbing database company)
* Clear step-by-step instructions
* The project context (climbing gym tracking system)
* Output formatting constraints
* The objective: generate business rules and a raw data dictionary

The purpose was to extract structured and consistent requirements before starting the database modeling phase.

## Output from the Generative AI

### Result of the Prompt

The AI returned:

* A list of business rules defining relationships between entities
* A structured raw data dictionary

The dictionary includes:

* Entity names
* Attribute definitions
* Data meanings
* Data types
* Constraints

This output serves as the foundation for building the database model.

## Looping File

The looping file is our MCD representation of the database
